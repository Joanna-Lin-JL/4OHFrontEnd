**Motivation**
The purpose of this app is to help students locate and find office hours and help TAs organize and notify students about their office hours. 

**Description of the project**
In the first view, the students and the teacher assistances (TAs) are able to sign in with their respected login information. After logging in, the TAs are able to create and edit office hours with informations such as course number, date, and time. Furthermore, they are able to check the amount of students who have RSVP for each of their office hours. On the students side, they can first input the course in which they are trying to find the office hours for. Then, they are able to filter through the days of week to find an office that fit their availabilities. After finishing, both TAs and students can log out.
