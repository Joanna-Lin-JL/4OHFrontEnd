Hack Challenge

Todo:
- fix Log In error
- Fix error in CollectionView for the StudentMainView (don't understand how sections work and how that impact the indexpath)
- fix the filtering in student view (not doing the right thing)
- Get all posts from backend that satisfies the time filtering
- fix the collection view cell width 
- create borders between the tableview cells
- fix shadow overlapping in ta view
- fix the text alignment for textfield
- Add course enrolled for the students
- Add warnings when course not found when doing filtering in student view
- remove pre-filled password field when log out of the views

For connecting with backend
- each username connected to password and certain variables: whether they are ta or student or both, what office hours they are attending (for students)

problems: 
- If TAs have the same name, their office hours will be mixed up (Unless I can make a .get request for TA's name using TA's id)

Ideas for fixing: 
createOH --> pass in the course (with id, course name, course code)


Implemented: 
- Decodable and Encodable for backend's models
- UIView, UIImageView, UITextField, UILabel, etc
- Custom UITableView with UIButton, UILabel, etc
- Selectable UITableView to check the attendance and connect to update attendance
- UICollectionView Filtering to filter by day of week
- Search bar filtering to filter by course code
- Login
- Present/dismiss Views for editing new OHs
- Push/pop Views for creating new OHs and sending from login screen
- Networking API with delete, post, get, etc
